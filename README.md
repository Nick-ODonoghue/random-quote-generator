## Overview

This is a random quote generator using and API and styled with Bootstrap

-   [API Github](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)
-   [EndPoint](https://api.quotable.io/random)

<br>

## Site To-Do

-   Set HTML
-   Style with bootstrap
-   Write js to interact with API

<br>

## What I learned

Working with APIs, I used an eventListener on DOMContentLoaded. With this I wrote an async function "getQuote" that called on page load, enabling a quote to appear on the page everytime it is view. Within this function I used a try catch for the fetch API method.

Styling with bootstrap. Whilst I'm not 100% sold on using css framworks, I'm happy this site doesn't immediately scream BOOTSTRAP when viewed.
